# Home-Equity-Loan
Explore several methods to assess whether certain characteristics or features can be used to predict whether an applicant defaults or pays his loan
Problem: We will explore several methods to see if certain characteristics or features can be used to predict whether an applicant defaults or pays his loan. Then we will use machine learning technics to develop a model to predict credit default. To reach this goal, we will implement a 3 steps project:

Step 1-Identify and handle missing values
Identify missing values

Evaluate the missing values

Deal with the missing values

Correct data format

Get indicator variables and assign them to dummy variables

Binning in order to categorise the loan value

Step 2- Analyse Individual Feature Patterns using Visualization and stastical technicques

Step 3- Develop the Model

The data come from : http://www.creditriskanalytics.net/datasets-private2.html The data set HMEQ reports characteristics and delinquency information for 5,960 home equity loans. A home equity loan is a loan where the obligor uses the equity of his or her home as the underlying collateral.
